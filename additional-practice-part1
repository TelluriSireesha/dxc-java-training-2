# Additional practice part 1

## Java Basics

Write a complete Java program in a class named `Victory` that prints the following output: 

```
//////////////////////
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
```

Write a complete Java program in a class named `Spikey` that prints the following output: 

```
  \/
 \\//
\\\///
///\\\
 //\\
  /\
```

Write a complete Java program called `Meta` whose output is the text that would be the source code of a Java program named Hello that prints "Hello, world!" as its output: 

```java
public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

Your program must produce exactly the output shown in order to pass (using exactly four spaces for each increment of indentation in the output). 

Write a complete Java program in a class named `Victory2` that prints the following output. Use at least one static method besides main to remove redundancy. 

```
//////////////////////
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
```

Write a complete Java program in a class named `Egg` that displays the following output: 

```
  _______
 /       \
/         \
-"-'-"-'-"-
\         /
 \_______/

```

Write a complete Java program in a class named `Egg2` that generates the following output. Use static methods to show structure and eliminate redundancy in your solution. 

```
  _______
 /       \
/         \
\         /
 \_______/
-"-'-"-'-"-

```

 Write a complete Java program in a class named `TwoRockets` that generates the following output. Use static methods to show structure and eliminate redundancy in your solution.

Note that there are two rocket ships next to each other. What redundancy can you eliminate using static methods? What redundancy cannot be eliminated?
